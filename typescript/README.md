The project is set up to be run as a node script.

- Run scripts: `npm run start`
- Compile to dist: `npm run build`
Compiled file will be in `./dist` folder.

## Running tests
Tests use [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) as the runner and [chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) for assertions.

List of available assertions: [https://www.chaijs.com/api/bdd/](https://www.chaijs.com/api/bdd/)

To run tests: `npm run test`

## Optional library
The template includes the [optional-js](https://github.com/JasonStorey/Optional.js) library.
It will be useful to avoid using null and ifs.
